## Booking system features
The booking system requests the following data:
- Setting start and end dates for bookings
- Setting check in and check out times
- Personal information input (specifics listed below)
- Number of pets

A 'Check' button is placed at the bottom of the page, amongst the 'Book' and 'Exit' buttons.
The 'Check' button executes a procedure that ensures the dates selected are available for booking and
meet the booking guidlines.

The price is calculated automatically and can be viewed in the 'View Bookings' section.
The personal information collected is: full name, postcode, phone number and email.
